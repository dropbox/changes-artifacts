Artifacts Store Database Migrations
===================================

Add any migration scripts titled <seq_no>_<short_message>.sql to this folder. Scripts will be
executed in <seq_no> order. Please see https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate#writing-migrations for
guidelines on how to write the migration scripts.

NOTE: Please run `go generate -v ./...` after making any changes to this folder. We are embedding the
migration script as a go file (this translation is performed by `go generate`). Without running `go
generate`, the migration file will *NOT* be included and applied.

Testing database migrations (backwards compatiblity):
-----------------------------------------------------
During client integration tests, we execute the same migrations that we would on prod. By default,
these tests will run against the previously deployed version (this *should* match the version on
prod). To verify that tests continue to run after migrations, bump up the migration level stored in
client_test.go#setupDB.
